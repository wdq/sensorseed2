# sensorseed2

I'm rewriting the old [SensorSeed](https://github.com/wdq/SensorSeed) program in Go.

The goal is to design the system to be more flexible in terms of adding and removing sensors and weather stations.

Using Go will also allow me to run the web application on something other than a Windows Server, so I can more easily and affordably host it in the cloud. 

I'll be writing about this project on my blog at https://quade.co.
